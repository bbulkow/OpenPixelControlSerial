# OpenPixelControlSerial - Rust OPC Server

High-performance OPC (Open Pixel Control) server written in Rust for driving serial LED strips.

## Overview

This is a high-performance Rust implementation of the OPC server that receives LED data over TCP and outputs to serial LED strips using various protocols. It provides the same functionality as the Python version but with better performance and lower resource usage.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Built with Rust for maximum speed and efficiency
- **Non-Blocking I/O**: Tokio async runtime for efficient TCP handling
- **Skip-Ahead Logic**: Automatic frame dropping when outputs are behind (single-depth queues)
- **Parallel Serial Writes**: Multiple serial ports transmit simultaneously in dedicated threads
- **Zero-Copy Operations**: Minimal memory allocations for pixel transformations
- **Multiple Protocols**: AWA and Adalight protocol support
- **Pixel Format Conversion**: RGB, GRB, BGR, RGBW, GRBW transformations
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux (including Raspberry Pi), and macOS

## Architecture

### Key Design Principles

1. **Minimize Copies**: Uses `Bytes` type for zero-copy buffer management
2. **Skip-Ahead**: Bounded channels (capacity=1) automatically drop stale frames
3. **Parallel Transmission**: One OS thread per serial port for true parallelism
4. **In-Place Transforms**: RGB↔GRB, RGB↔BGR transforms modify data in-place

### Components

- **OPC Server (async)**: Non-blocking TCP listener using Tokio
- **Output Handlers**: One thread per serial port with blocking serial writes
- **Channel System**: `tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(1)` per output for auto frame replacement
- **Pixel Transformer**: Zero-copy for most transforms, new allocation only for RGBW

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (1.70 or later)
- Serial port access permissions (Linux: add user to `dialout` group)

### Building

```bash
cd opc-server-rs
cargo build --release
```

The optimized binary will be at `target/release/opc_server` (or `opc_server.exe` on Windows).

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
cargo run --release -- ../opc-server-py/config.json
```

Or with the compiled binary:

```bash
./target/release/opc_server ../opc-server-py/config.json
```

### With Debug Statistics

```bash
cargo run --release -- ../opc-server-py/config.json --debug
```

Debug mode prints FPS statistics every 5 seconds showing received and sent frame rates for each output.

### Command Line Options

```
Usage: opc_server [OPTIONS] <CONFIG>

Arguments:
  <CONFIG>  Path to configuration file (JSON)

Options:
  -d, --debug    Enable debug output (statistics)
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

## Configuration

Uses the same JSON configuration format as the Python implementation. See `../config/config.example.json` for a complete example.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "opc": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 7890
  },
  "outputs": [
    {
      "port": "COM4",
      "protocol": "awa",
      "baud_rate": 2000000,
      "opc_channel": 0,
      "led_count": 300,
      "opc_offset": 0,
      "pixel_format": "GRB"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing

### Using the Test Client

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the Rust server
cd opc-server-rs
cargo run --release -- ../opc-server-py/config.json --debug

# Terminal 2: Run test client
cd ../opc-test
python test_client.py --pattern rainbow --leds 300
```

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

## Performance

The Rust implementation offers significant performance improvements over Python:

- **Lower Latency**: Sub-millisecond frame processing
- **Lower CPU Usage**: Efficient async I/O and true parallel serial writes
- **Lower Memory**: Better memory management with zero-copy operations
- **Higher Throughput**: Can handle higher frame rates with multiple outputs

## Supported Protocols

### AWA Protocol (HyperSerialPico)

**Status: Tested and working**

High-speed protocol with Fletcher checksum for data integrity. Tested extensively with HyperSerialPico devices.

### Adalight Protocol

**Status: Implemented, not tested**

Standard Adalight protocol. Implementation matches Python version but hasn't been tested with actual hardware.

## Implementation Details

### Skip-Ahead Logic

The server uses `tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(1)` for each output:
- Bounded channel with capacity 1
- `try_send()` on sender: if full, old frame is automatically discarded
- Worker thread blocks efficiently on `recv()` when idle
- No explicit queue management needed

### Parallel Serial Writes

Each serial output runs in a dedicated OS thread:
- Blocking serial writes (inherently synchronous operation)
- True parallelism across multiple ports
- No GIL limitations like Python
- Worker threads are isolated from async runtime

### Zero-Copy Optimization

- Uses `bytes::Bytes` for reference-counted buffer slicing
- In-place transformations for RGB/GRB/BGR (byte swapping only)
- New allocation only for RGBW transforms (stride change from 3 to 4)
- Minimal copying in TCP → Serial pipeline

## Building for Production

### Optimized Release Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The release profile in `Cargo.toml` includes:
- `opt-level = 3`: Maximum optimizations
- `lto = true`: Link-time optimization
- `codegen-units = 1`: Better optimization at cost of compile time

### Cross-Compilation

For Raspberry Pi (from x86_64 Linux):

```bash
# Install cross-compilation tools
rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf

# Build
cargo build --release --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Error opening serial port"

- Ensure port exists and correct name (e.g., `COM4` on Windows, `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux)
- On Linux: Add user to `dialout` group: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`
- Check port isn't in use by another application

### Build Errors

- Ensure Rust toolchain is up to date: `rustup update`
- On Linux, you may need pkg-config and libudev: `sudo apt install pkg-config libudev-dev`

### Performance Issues

- Use `--release` flag (debug builds are 10-100x slower)
- Check baud rate is appropriate for your LED count and desired FPS
- Monitor with `--debug` flag to see actual frame rates
